Machine Learning Basics


    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that
    enable computers to perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. Instead, these systems learn from data and improve their
    performance over time.

    Types of Machine Learning:
    1. Supervised Learning: The model is trained on labeled data, where the input-output pairs are provided.
    2. Unsupervised Learning: The model is trained on unlabeled data and must find patterns or structures within the data.
    3. Reinforcement Learning: The model learns by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

    Applications include image recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
